# SustainableEnergyProductionStimulation

This is a never-ending project in which I continuously invest my time to improve my architectural and development skills and to implement things I have learned so far. It shows off my current skills. It implements various methods of implementation.

By no means am I advocating that this solution is the best one for the presented problem.

Technologies and architectures I used are the following
- Clean Architecture
- Domain Driven Design (DDD)
- CQRS
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Clean Code principles from Uncle Bob
- Repository pattern
- Specification pattern
- Unit of Work pattern
- Unit testing
- C# 7.2
- Entity Framework Core 2
- Fluent Validation
- Humanizer
- Light.GuardClauses
- Dependency Injection (Unity, SimpleInjector, Autofac)
- Dapper.
- ASP.NET Core

Planned

- NoSql (Cosmos Db)
- RabbitMQ
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
