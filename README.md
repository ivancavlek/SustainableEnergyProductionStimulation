# SustainableEnergyProductionStimulation

This is a never-ending project in which I continuously invest my time to improve my architectural and development skills and to implement things I have learned so far. It shows off my current skills. It implements various methods of implementation.

By no means am I advocating that this solution is the best one for the presented problem.

Technologies and architectures I used are the following
- Domain Driven Design
- CQRS
- CQS
- Unit testing
- C# 6
- Entity Framework 6
- Fluent Validation
- Humanizer

Planned
- Dapper
- NoSql (DocumentDb or MongoDb)
- RabbitMQ
- ASP.NET MVC
- ASP.NET Web API
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Knockout or other JavaScript framework/library
